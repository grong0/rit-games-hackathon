## Inspiration
We wanted an easy way to view and report toxic incidents around your area.

## What it does
It displays a map where users can view and review different locations such as restaurants, buildings, basically anything.

## How we built it
We used React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend with use of the Google Maps API.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some issues with what backend to use and if we even wanted to use a framework for the frontend. We also never used the Google Maps API before, so it was a bit of a challenge to get some of the stuff working.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some accomplishments we're proud of is the implementation of the Google Maps API and Firebase backend.

## What we learned
We learned how to implement a user interactive map using the Google Maps API and use Firebase as a backend for a website.

## What's next for Protection Services
If we were to work on this further, we would implement more features including the option to rate a location positively in case it goes out of their way to support under-represented individuals.
